date: 2017-7-21

I recently completed writing up a paper about phase retrival. I proposed a new method a to solve random 
systems of quadratic equations using Tanh weighted wirtinger flow. You can get the paper at [here]({{ site.url }}/assests/geom.pdf).
The source codes are in the [repository](https://github.com/alncat/TanhWF).
