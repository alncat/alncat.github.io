I am a graduate student in Rice University's Applied Physics program.
    My current research is mainly about developing novel crystallographic 
    methods. In spare time, I am an android developer, an artificial intelligence learner and an algorithm designer.

Here is [my resume]({{http://alncat.github.io}}/resume/res.pdf) for your reference.
